# CS305 Software Security

The client was a company called Artemis Financial.  This is a financial consulting firm.  Their financial plans include savings, retirement, investments and insurance.  They would like to modernize their operations.  They want us to examine their web-based software application and provide guidance for any security vulnerabilities.  
I chose to user the cipher algorithm of AES to help secure customers data.  Securely coding you applications will help meet your clients needs.   Their financial data needs to be secure.  Code quality ensures you have a readable code so others can collaborate with you.  Error handling is another big issue.  This falls under secure coding.  
The checksum verification exercise was challenging but will help secure customers data by producing a hash key.  The hash  key will be needed to download sensitive data.  I integrated the tool of OWASP dependency check.  I was able to learn how this tool is used in software security.  This tool is used to publicly disclose security vulnerabilities during the development process.  There are ways to suppress false negatives so you don't see the vulnerabilities that aren't important. 
We further increased layers of security but implementing a self signed certificate.  This tool is used during the testing and development phases of a project.  Itâ€™s a cost effective tool for testing since its free.  
The skills of adding a cypher algorithm, self signed certificates, using a checksum to produce a hash key and checking on vulnerability dependencies.
